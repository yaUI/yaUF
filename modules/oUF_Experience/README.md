## Description

oUF Experience is a element plug-in made for the unitframe framework oUF.
It does nothing by itself, and requires a layout that supports it to function.

It has the following features:

- Experience/honor bar.
- Rested bar (optional).
- Tags.
- Automatically hides under certain conditions:
	- Player has reached max level.
	- Player has locked their experience gain.
	- Player has reached trial account level cap.
	- Player is in a vehicle.
	- Player has disabled honor-tracking.

For details on how to implement this in your own layout, please see the wiki:
